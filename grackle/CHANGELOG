== Version 3.0 ==
_Release date - Nov 1, 2016_

  * New feature: New API with fields arrays provided in a struct.
  * New feature: Added support for radiation transfer fields.
  * New feature: Added atomic self-shielding of UV backgrounds.
  * New feature: Added support for providing arrays of volumetric and
	specific heating rates.
  * Enhcancement: added Case B recombination cooling rates and updated
	Case A rates.
  * Enhancement: updated testing framework to use pytest parametrized
	tests.
  * Bugfix: fixed kunit normalization for k4 Case B recombination rate.
  * Bugfix: fixed scaling of low-density H2 cooling rate and use newer H2
	LTE rate in all appropriate places.
  * Significant documentation updates and improvements.

== Version 2.2 ==
_Release date - May 18, 2016_

  * New feature: Added OpenMP support.
  * New feature: Added test suite and continuous integration testing.
  * New feature: Added support for old-style Cloudy tables used in Enzo's
	Cloudy cooling routine.  Added cooling table for high density
	metal cooling, cloudy_metals_2008_3D.h5.
  * Enhancement: Many primordial chemistry updates: updated reactions
	rates for H ionization, H- formation/destruction, H2 dissociation,
	H2+ formation, H2 LTE cooling, and HD low density cooling.  Added
	reactions for collisional ionization of H by H and H by He.
  * Enhancement: Refactored and improved pygrackle interface.
  * Bugfix: Fixed conversion of comoving to proper coordinates in
	calculation of temperature field in tabulated mode.  This only
	affected calls to calculate_temperature in tabulated mode, but not
	the actual cooling solver.
  * Removed code for old collisional rates.
  * Reduced size of row temporary variables in chemistry/cooling solver.
  * Fixed makefiles for TACC Stampede and NCSA Blue Waters.
  * Moderate documentation improvements.

== Version 2.1 ==
_Release date - Jun 3, 2015_

  * New feature: Added cooling_cell.py script to simulate the cooling of a
	single cell over time.
  * Enhancement: k19 reaction added to H- calculation.
  * Enhancement: Build system converted to using libtool.
  * Enhancement: Updated value of solar metal mass fraction to be
	consistent with Cloudy.
  * Enhancement: Mean molecular weight calculation in tabulated mode now
	correctly accounts for photo-ionization from UV backgrounds.
  * Bugfix: Metal field only considered in temperature calculation in
	tabulated mode if actually present.

== Version 2.0.1 ==
_Release date - Jan 30, 2015_

  * Enhancement: Physically motivated temperature cutoff for photo-
	electric heating added.
  * Bugfix: Spatially constant photo-electric heating now included in
	purely tabulated cooling mode.
  * Bugfix: Make sure grackle_data_file string is null-terminated.
  * Minor compilation bugfixes.
  * Installation docs updated.

== Version 2.0 ==
_Release date - Oct 1, 2014_

  * Enhancement: All C++ files converted to C for easier integration into
	C and Fortran code
  * Enhancement: Main chemistry data structure moved into grackle
	namespace.  The user is no longer responsible for carrying it.
  * Enhancement: Changeable integer precision compile flag removed for
	greater simplicity
  * Enhancement: Internal chemistry and cooling calculation now always
	done in double precision with gr_float type only used for baryon
	fields.  The Grackle can now be reliably run in 32-bit mode.
  * Enhancement: Changeable Fortran baryon field precision now controlled
	with a custom variable type for better stability
  * Enhancement: Examples now available for C, C++, and Fortran codes
  * Enhancement: Grackle output now configurable so that all processors do
	not have to print info
  * Enhancement: Version and compile options now written to a file at run
	start-up

== Version 1.1 ==
_Release date - Oct 1, 2014_

  * New feature: Static library build option
  * Enhancement: Updated H-, H2, and HD chemistry and cooling rates
  * Enhancement: Sign of returned cooling time is now preserved

== Version 1.0 ==
_Release date - Jan 10, 2014_
