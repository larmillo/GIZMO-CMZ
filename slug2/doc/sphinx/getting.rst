Getting SLUG
============

SLUG is available at `https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/slug2 <https://bitbucket.org/krumholz/slug2>`_. The easiest way to download a copy is via `git <http://git-scm.com/>`_. If you have git, you can download SLUG by doing::

  git clone https://krumholz@bitbucket.org/krumholz/slug2.git

In addition to the core SLUG code, the Bayesian inference tools cluster_slug and sfr_slug require large libraries of simulations on which to operate. These are not included in the git repository due to their sizes. You can download these from `http://www.slugsps.com/data <http://www.slugsps.com/data>`_.
